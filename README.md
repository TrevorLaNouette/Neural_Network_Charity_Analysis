# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Technical skills used in this project:

Tensorflow
Python
Pandas
Sklearn

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Using the features in the provided dataset help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, we received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns

APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type

AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry

CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification

USE_CASE—Use case for funding

ORGANIZATION—Organization type

STATUS—Active status

INCOME_AMT—Income classification

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application

ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested

IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report.

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model

Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model

Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)

## Results:
### Data Preprocessing:

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
